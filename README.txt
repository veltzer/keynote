Keynote is a whole new way of thinking about slide shows.

Instead of writing slides inside some big bloat like open office
you write your slides in nice, clean, concise, XML files with
almost no regard to presentation and only to content.
You then get to see them inside your browser.
I plan, and have started work on, conversion tools from keynote/XML
to pdf, odp and other formats.

You can find more info about it in http://www.veltzer.net/keynote and also
see a live demo there.
