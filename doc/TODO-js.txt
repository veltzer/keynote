keynote-js:
===========
- get ridd of the template creating divs.
- get to good background specification for the template.
- do a demo of a slide show which is not full screen and see what needs to be
	fixed to get it to work.
	- how to catch resize events on regular elements and not just on the whole
		window.
	- how to catch keyboard events on a part of the screen.
	- how to pop up a toolbar in order to allow various commands and issues.
- use the template in my application.
- make the template creation code simpler.
- make two more templates and demo them.
- make the screen go blank at the end of the presentation.

Layout managers:
- create a layout manager for every slide type:
	The center layout manager.
	The flow layout manager (downwards).
	Two columns.
	Table

Transitions:
- do OO design for transitions and allow a user to select one of them.

UI:
- add a menu that pops up and allows one to jump to a slide number etc...

UI usability:
- concepts, urls, links and more:
	- when a user hovers over a concept show the definition of that concept.
		The definition will be inserted by the author of the document.
	- when a user hovers over a url, show a small version of that url (there are libraries to
		help you with that).
	- when a user hovers over an Image show help for that image.
	- when a user hovers over an email, give a dialog to send email to that address.
	- when a user hovers over a word, give a dictionary definiton for that word.
		or wikipedia definiton for that concept.

User customisation of style:
- allow the user to customize EVERY SLIDE. The idea is that the user could give an id
to every element (at the xml level). keynote will attach that id and turn it into an HTML
id. Now the user can use that id in CSS to customize the slide show.
- mention that this is not recommended since it's not the point of keynote to focus
on presentation but rather on content.
