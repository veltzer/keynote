Core functionality:
===================
- a feature that allow the author of a slideshow to add lecture notes to each slide to be viewed by the
lecturer only. Maybe two browsers communicating? Maybe two tabs, one on each screen? chrome can do that!
- add DTD and schema to validate the document.
- before processing the document validate it.
- add external tool to validate the document.
	(or maybe use an existing tool?!?)
- document how to edit a presentation within eclipse say with XML support.
