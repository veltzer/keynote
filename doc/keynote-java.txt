The keynote/java project
========================
The purpose of the project: to create pdf from the keynote presentations.
It works by accepting an XML file that describes the presentation and producing
a pdf of that presentation. HTML and other formats may be supported in the future.

Technologies:
- itext for producing the pdf.
- some kind of XML DOM parser for reading the input.
	Discussion: why DOM? We may want to create a table of content and
	slide numbers and in order to do that we need access to information that
	can only be deduced if you read the entire document.
	SAX would have been more efficient memory wise but this does not seem
	to be a killer feature since even large presentations fit in RAM nicely.
- some kind of command line argument parser for command line integration.
- ant for building easily on the command line.
- some kind of tool for syntax highlighting of code snipplets.
	which one ?!? get one!
	AntLR looks good for this. check it out.

further approaches that I can try:
xslt the presentation and then fop it.
use the open office API and create an odp file
	and then convert it to pdf or what ever.
XSLT to create the openoffice presentation? after all openoffice
	is an XML document.
YAML could be used as input as well.
packaging it. It does not concern showing it in any medium.

viewing the ppts created with keynote-java
==========================================
I tried viewing ppts with libre office and it looks like on a wide screen it looks the same
as showing a ppt created with itext in landscape mode.
Itext in portrait mode does look wrong (too thin).
