keynote-js is the javascript code that knows how to show keynote presentations

Layout managers
===============
Do I need a layout manager per slide or per element? Or in other words: do layout managers have
info of their own? Well - yes. In theory they could. For instance the 'lines' attribute which translates
to density of text could be potentially overridden by the user. Another example is table layour manager
where the user wants to set the number of columns and rows.

Descision:
Create a layout mananger for each object. They are small anyway.

Templates in keynotejs are based on the following ideas:
========================================================
Template: an object which gets the data of a slide and knows how to show it on the screen.

Each template is a bunch of layout managers arranged together to get a certain effect.
Examples of templates are:
1. Title with Bullets
2. Title and two columns of bullets.
3. Title and image/drawing.
