The present tool aims to help in creating presentations.
It works by accepting an XML file that describes the presentation and producing
a pdf of that presentation. HTML and other formats may be supported in the future.

Technologies:
- itext for producing the pdf.
- some kind of XML DOM parser for reading the input.
- some kind of command line argument parser for command line integration.
- ant for building easily on the command line.
- some kind of tool for syntax highlighting of code snipplets.
