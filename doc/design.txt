The present tool aims to help in creating presentations.
It works by accepting an XML file that describes the presentation and producing
a pdf of that presentation. HTML and other formats may be supported in the future.

Technologies:
- itext for producing the pdf.
- some kind of XML DOM parser for reading the input.
- some kind of command line argument parser for command line integration.
- ant for building easily on the command line.
- some kind of tool for syntax highlighting of code snipplets.

further approaches that I can try:
xslt the presentation and then fop it.
use the open office API and create an odp file
	and then convert it to pdf or what ever.
XSLT to create the openoffice presentation? after all openoffice
	is an XML document.
YAML could be used as input as well.
