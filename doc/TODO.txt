- move to prototype.js in this project.
- do some tightening up of the schema.
- make sure that code looks right and that the first presentation looks right.
- pressing the email in the first slide of keynote.xml does not work. Check it out
	and fix it.
- make the code in the mgr.js more forgiving: if there is no copyright then dont
	have it, same for title.
