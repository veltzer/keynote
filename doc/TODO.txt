now:
====
- get ridd of the warnings that I have when compiling with the RELEASE_6
	stuff.
- there is a printing that takes place when printing.
- get ridd of the php in this project and move to javascript
	on the client side.
- convert this project to templar.
- add website on github for this project.
- return checking for docs and document everything.

javascript
==========
- pressing the email in the first slide of keynote.xml does not work. Check it out
	and fix it.
- the long bullet in the test of the new template doesn't look good.
- fix the stuff that doesnt look good.
- there are a lot of paramters.
	get some kind of config in order.
- get ridd of the template creating divs.
- get to good background specification for the template.
- do a demo of a slide show which is not full screen and see what needs to be
	fixed to get it to work.
	- how to catch resize events on regular elements and not just on the whole
		window.
	- how to catch keyboard events on a part of the screen.
	- how to pop up a toolbar in order to allow various commands and issues.
- use the template in my application.
- make the template creation code simpler.
- make two more templates and demo them.
- make the screen go blank at the end of the presentation.

Layout managers:
- create a layout manager for every slide type:
	The center layout manager.
	The flow layout manager (downwards).
	Two columns.
	Table

Transitions:
- do OO design for transitions and allow a user to select one of them.

UI:
- add a menu that pops up and allows one to jump to a slide number etc...

UI usability:
- concepts, urls, links and more:
	- when a user hovers over a concept show the definition of that concept.
		The definition will be inserted by the author of the document.
	- when a user hovers over a url, show a small version of that url (there are libraries to
		help you with that).
	- when a user hovers over an Image show help for that image.
	- when a user hovers over an email, give a dialog to send email to that address.
	- when a user hovers over a word, give a dictionary definiton for that word.
		or wikipedia definiton for that concept.

User customisation of style:
- allow the user to customize EVERY SLIDE. The idea is that the user could give an id
to every element (at the xml level). keynote will attach that id and turn it into an HTML
id. Now the user can use that id in CSS to customize the slide show.
- mention that this is not recommended since it's not the point of keynote to focus
on presentation but rather on content.

schema
======
- do some tightening up of the schema.
- document the schema and make sure I can see the documentation in eclipse
	when writing XML documents.
- see how to use the xsd in netbeans as well.

website
=======
1. mention the technologies used in this project.
2. show several presentations and not just one
	(maybe with a loop show all of them ?!?)
3. have a version for this project using git and have the version
	appear in the downloads.
4. have pages showing how to write presentations.
	- page about writing it in eclipse.
	- page about writing it in netbeans.
	- page about writing it on the command line in linux
		and validating via some command line tools (xmllint?!?).

spelling
========
move the local dictionary file for aspell from ~/.aspell.[en|he].pws
to this folder (under support?!?)

build system
============
- release the flags for documentation checks on the code.
	(and write the documentation).
- add generation of documentation.
- add pdmt to build this project and do mako on it.
- start building the java part from the command line (ant).

features
========
- a feature that allow the author of a slideshow to add lecture notes to each slide to be viewed by the
lecturer only. Maybe two browsers communicating? Maybe two tabs, one on each screen? chrome can do that!

java
====
- if a list gets too long and we move on to a new slide then the header should be added automatically.
- list bullets are ugly (no sign). Add one.
- support for code inlined within text (different font).
- support for emphasis within the text.
- support for strike-though (wrong) within the text.
- support for hyper links with different color or real hyperlinks?!?
	(mail, url).
- color for headers, bullets, background.
- background image.
- copyright at the bottom.
- first page (main page).
- support for sections.
	A section is a collection of slides
	A presentation is a collection of sections.
- showing on which slide we are in (in the entire presentation, in the entire slide).
- add barcode support.
- support for images.
- support for code inlined.
- compress the pdf.
- sign the pdf.
- optimize the pdf (with the itext toolkit preferably).
- the pdf should carry the meta data from the xml with it.
- support for technical drawings within the presentation ?
	or maybe with some other tool ?
- maybe the best way is to use SVG ?
