Core functionality:
===================
Core functionality refers to the xml file for presentations, it's semantics, writing and validating it,

Have my own tool (java) that checks the presentations and does spell checking on their content.
	This tool would be able to read a list of spell checker exclusions at the start of the presentation.

This is a discussion of the presentation.xml syntax and it's reasoning:
=======================================================================

titles should be in their own <title> because I may want to do <title>this is <emphasis>my</emphasis> slide</title>
and other things.
same is for <copyright> and any other complex content

<bullet> inside <bullet> should be allowed to have sub bullets.
The template will arrange them.

<bullet> should be in <bulletlist>. This would give a place where I could put styles about the list
of bullets (numbered, size of fonts, etc...).

Links between bullets:
======================
We don't want a boring slide show that only goes to the next slide.
Each slide could point to many slides as next slide (only the next as default).
On the screen it will enable the user to select where to go.
The slide could have many exists, one would be marked as default (and will be the
one which one goes to if one just presses the "next" button on a slide transition
dongle...).

Time for slide
==============
The user could attach time attributes to slides, bullets or topicss so this
will enable time measuring features.

topics
======
A topic is a higher level division of a presentation. A topics is just
a collection of slides.
This will enable to jump to a specific topic and the like.
This will require a <topic> element.

stats
=====
A tool should be provided that gets statistics from a presentation. It will get
the number of slides etc.

Including between presentation:
===============================
Presentations should be able to include parts or slides from other presentations easily.
This should be enabled using some kind of XML inclusion technology. xinclude ?!?
